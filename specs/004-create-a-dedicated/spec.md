# Feature Specification: Cryptocurrency Detail Page

**Feature Branch**: `004-create-a-dedicated`
**Created**: 2025-10-22
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a dedicated page that displays comprehensive information about a single cryptocurrency when a user clicks on a coin from the list. The page should fetch and display detailed coin data including price history, market statistics, description, and links, providing users with in-depth information to make informed decisions. This enhances the user experience by allowing users to drill down from the overview list into specific coins they're interested in tracking or investing in."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Feature identified: Detail page for cryptocurrency information

   ‚Üí Data: Price history, market statistics, coin description, external links
   ‚Üí Constraints: Information must be comprehensive and support decision-making
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Marked with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] where applicable
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Clear user flow: List ‚Üí Click ‚Üí Detail page ‚Üí View information
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí Coin data, price history, market statistics
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí Spec focused on user value without implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-22
- Q: What is the primary data source for displaying cryptocurrency information on the detail page? ‚Üí A: Hybrid - show public market data plus user's exchange holdings/positions if authenticated
- Q: What time periods should be available for viewing price history charts? ‚Üí A: Multiple fixed periods - 24h, 7d, 30d, 1y
- Q: Should the page display additional portfolio actions for authenticated users? ‚Üí A: View-only - no actions, just display holdings information
- Q: What URL structure should be used for coin detail pages? ‚Üí A: Coin ID/slug - `/coins/bitcoin` format
- Q: Should price data update in real-time while users view the detail page? ‚Üí A: Periodic refresh - update prices every 30-60 seconds automatically

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A user browsing the cryptocurrency list wants to learn more about a specific coin before making investment decisions. They click on a coin from the list and are taken to a dedicated detail page that shows comprehensive information including current and historical prices, market statistics (market cap, volume, supply), a description of the cryptocurrency, and links to official resources. This allows them to make informed decisions about tracking or investing in that cryptocurrency.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is viewing the cryptocurrency list, **When** they click on any coin, **Then** they are navigated to a detail page specific to that coin
2. **Given** a user is on a coin detail page, **When** the page loads, **Then** they see the coin's current price, 24-hour change, and basic identification (name, symbol, logo)
8. **Given** a user is viewing a coin detail page, **When** 30-60 seconds have elapsed, **Then** the price data automatically refreshes with a visual indicator showing the update
3. **Given** a user is viewing a coin detail page, **When** they scroll down, **Then** they see historical price data displayed in a visual format with options to switch between 24h, 7d, 30d, and 1y time periods
4. **Given** a user is on a coin detail page, **When** they look at market statistics, **Then** they see relevant metrics like market cap, trading volume, and circulating supply
5. **Given** a user wants to learn about a cryptocurrency, **When** they view the detail page, **Then** they see a description explaining what the cryptocurrency is
6. **Given** a user wants to verify information or learn more, **When** they view the detail page, **Then** they see links to official resources (website, whitepaper, social media, etc.)
7. **Given** a user has finished reviewing a coin, **When** they want to return to the list, **Then** they can easily navigate back to the overview page

### Edge Cases
- What happens when coin data is temporarily unavailable or fails to load?
- How does the system handle coins with incomplete information (missing description, no links, limited price history)?
- What happens if a user directly accesses a detail page URL for a coin that doesn't exist or is no longer supported (e.g., `/coins/invalid-slug`)?
- How is price history displayed for newly listed coins with limited historical data?
- What happens when external links are broken or unavailable?
- How does the page handle very long descriptions or large amounts of text?
