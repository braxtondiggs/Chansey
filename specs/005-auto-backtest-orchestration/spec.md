# Feature Specification: Automated Backtesting Orchestration

**Feature Branch**: `005-auto-backtest-orchestration`
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Extend the current backtesting automation so the platform independently generates run configurations, performs walk-forward analysis, scores strategies, identifies live trading candidates, monitors deployed strategies, maintains audit trails, and provides dashboard visibility"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Automated Strategy Discovery & Evaluation (Priority: P1)

As a quantitative analyst, I want the system to automatically generate and evaluate trading strategies without manual intervention, so I can discover profitable strategies more efficiently while focusing on higher-level research.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - automating the time-intensive process of strategy discovery and evaluation, which currently requires manual configuration and monitoring.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by verifying the system generates strategy configurations, runs backtests, and produces ranked results without any user input after initial setup.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the system is configured with available strategy types and parameter ranges, **When** a scheduled evaluation cycle begins, **Then** the system generates at least 60 unique strategy configurations for testing.
2. **Given** market data is available for the past 5 years, **When** strategies are generated, **Then** each strategy undergoes walk-forward analysis with rolling train/test windows.
3. **Given** a strategy has completed backtesting, **When** results are calculated, **Then** the system produces a comprehensive score based on risk-adjusted returns, drawdowns, and volatility.
4. **Given** market volatility changes by more than 20%, **When** detected by the system, **Then** existing strategies are automatically re-evaluated within 24 hours.

### User Story 2 - Live Trading Promotion & Risk Management (Priority: P1)

As a portfolio manager, I want the system to automatically identify high-performing strategies for live trading while enforcing strict risk controls, so I can deploy capital safely without manual oversight of every strategy.

**Why this priority**: Critical for production deployment - ensures only validated strategies trade real capital and includes safeguards against losses.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by simulating strategy promotion gates, capital allocation, and rollback triggers using historical performance data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a strategy scores in the top 10% for 30 consecutive days, **When** promotion gates are evaluated, **Then** the strategy is flagged as a live trading candidate with recommended capital allocation.
2. **Given** a live strategy is deployed with $10,000 capital, **When** it underperforms the market-cap-weighted benchmark by 15% over 30 days, **Then** the system automatically deactivates the strategy and returns capital to reserves.
3. **Given** 35 strategies are running live, **When** a new candidate is promoted, **Then** the lowest-performing strategy is demoted to maintain the 35-strategy limit.
4. **Given** a live strategy experiences a 20% drawdown, **When** risk limits are checked, **Then** the system reduces position sizes by 50% and sends an alert.

### User Story 3 - Performance Monitoring & Drift Detection (Priority: P2)

As a risk manager, I want continuous monitoring of deployed strategies with automatic detection of performance drift, so I can maintain portfolio stability and react quickly to degrading strategies.

**Why this priority**: Essential for maintaining long-term performance but can function with manual monitoring initially.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by deploying strategies and simulating various drift scenarios to verify detection and alerting mechanisms.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a strategy has been live for 90 days, **When** its Sharpe ratio drops below 50% of backtest expectations, **Then** the system triggers drift alert and schedules re-backtesting.
2. **Given** market regime changes from low to high volatility (crossing 75th percentile), **When** detected by the monitoring system, **Then** all affected strategies are re-ranked within 12 hours.
3. **Given** a strategy shows correlation > 0.8 with another live strategy, **When** daily correlations are calculated, **Then** the system flags potential redundancy and suggests deactivation.

---

### User Story 4 - Experiment Tracking & Auditability (Priority: P2)

As a compliance officer, I want complete audit trails of all strategy experiments and deployments, so I can demonstrate regulatory compliance and investigate any trading anomalies.

**Why this priority**: Required for regulatory compliance and forensic analysis but not blocking for core functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by running strategies and verifying all decisions, parameters, and results are logged and retrievable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a strategy has been tested, **When** viewing its history, **Then** I can see all versions, parameter changes, dataset checksums, and complete results for 5 years.
2. **Given** a live trading decision was made 6 months ago, **When** investigating the decision, **Then** I can retrieve the exact market conditions, strategy parameters, and scoring metrics used.
3. **Given** a strategy was rolled back, **When** reviewing the event, **Then** I can see the trigger condition, performance metrics, and exact timestamp of deactivation.

---

### User Story 5 - Dashboard Visibility & Control (Priority: P3)

As a trading team member, I want comprehensive dashboards showing strategy performance and rankings, so I can understand portfolio composition and make informed oversight decisions.

**Why this priority**: Enhances usability and transparency but core automation can function without visual interfaces initially.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying dashboard displays accurate real-time data and historical trends for all strategies.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I access the strategy dashboard, **When** viewing current deployments, **Then** I see all 35 live strategies with real-time P&L, risk metrics, and health status.
2. **Given** I want to analyze strategy performance, **When** accessing the scorecard view, **Then** I see rankings for all 60 evaluated strategies with detailed metrics.
3. **Given** I have analyst role permissions, **When** attempting to override automated decisions, **Then** I can only view but not modify strategy deployments.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when market data feed is interrupted during backtesting?
- How does system handle strategies that become profitable only in specific market regimes?
- What occurs when correlation between strategies suddenly spikes during market stress?
- How are partial fills and slippage incorporated into live performance tracking?
- What happens when the 30-day benchmark itself experiences extreme volatility?
- How does the system handle strategy parameters that worked historically but violate current risk limits?
