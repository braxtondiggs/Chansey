# Research Report: Automated Backtesting Orchestration

**Date**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: Automated Backtesting Orchestration
**Status**: Complete

## Executive Summary

This research document provides implementation guidance for extending the Chansey platform's backtesting capabilities with fully automated orchestration. The research covers six key areas: walk-forward analysis, unified scoring frameworks, market regime detection, drift detection, audit logging, and promotion gates with risk controls.

## Key Decisions and Technologies

### 1. Walk-Forward Analysis Implementation

**Decision**: Use rolling window approach with 60/40 train/test split
**Rationale**:
- Rolling windows adapt to market regime changes better than anchored windows
- 60/40 split balances training data sufficiency with out-of-sample validation
- Crypto markets exhibit high regime variability requiring adaptive approaches

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Anchored windows: Rejected due to inability to adapt to regime changes
- 80/20 split: Rejected as insufficient test data for volatile crypto markets
- Monte Carlo simulation: Deferred to future enhancement due to computational cost

**Implementation Details**:
- 180-day training window, 90-day test window, 30-day step size
- Process 3 windows in parallel via BullMQ to optimize throughput
- Store intermediate results in PostgreSQL for failure recovery

### 2. Unified Scoring Framework

**Decision**: Multi-factor scoring with 7 weighted components
**Rationale**:
- Balances return, risk, and robustness metrics
- Walk-forward degradation (20% weight) prevents overfitting
- Correlation scoring (10% weight) ensures portfolio diversification

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single metric (Sharpe only): Rejected as insufficient for comprehensive evaluation
- Machine learning ensemble: Rejected as too opaque for regulatory compliance
- Equal weighting: Rejected as some metrics more predictive than others

**Component Weights**:
- Sharpe Ratio: 25% - Primary risk-adjusted return metric
- Calmar Ratio: 15% - Drawdown consideration
- Win Rate: 10% - Consistency measure
- Profit Factor: 10% - Win/loss magnitude
- WFA Degradation: 20% - Overfitting penalty
- Stability: 10% - Trade distribution
- Correlation: 10% - Portfolio diversification

### 3. Market Regime Detection

**Decision**: Realized volatility percentiles with 30-day rolling calculation
**Rationale**:
- Simple, interpretable, and computationally efficient
- 365-day lookback provides stable historical reference
- Percentile thresholds (25th, 50th, 75th, 90th) align with industry standards

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Hidden Markov Models: Deferred due to complexity and interpretability
- GARCH models: Rejected as overly complex for initial implementation
- Simple moving averages: Rejected as insufficiently responsive to volatility shifts

**Regime Classifications**:
- Low Volatility: < 25th percentile
- Normal: 25th-75th percentile
- High Volatility: 75th-90th percentile
- Extreme Volatility: > 90th percentile

### 4. Performance Drift Detection

**Decision**: Statistical Process Control with multiple threshold checks
**Rationale**:
- Rapid detection via control charts
- Multiple metrics prevent false positives
- 30-day lookback balances responsiveness with stability

**Alternatives Considered**:
- CUSUM charts only: Rejected as single method insufficient
- Fixed thresholds only: Rejected as not adaptive to strategy characteristics
- Machine learning anomaly detection: Deferred due to training data requirements

**Drift Thresholds**:
- Sharpe degradation: 50% worse than backtest
- Return underperformance: 15% below expectation
- Drawdown excess: 1.5x backtest maximum
- Win rate delta: 20 percentage points
- Consecutive losses: 10 trades
- Volatility ratio: 2x expected

### 5. Audit Logging Architecture

**Decision**: Immutable PostgreSQL storage with SHA-256 integrity hashing
**Rationale**:
- Regulatory compliance requires tamper-proof logs
- 5-year retention meets financial industry standards
- Partitioning by month enables efficient archival

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Blockchain storage: Rejected as excessive overhead for internal audit
- File-based logging only: Rejected as insufficient for complex queries
- NoSQL storage: Rejected due to lack of ACID guarantees

**Implementation Features**:
- Cryptographic integrity verification
- Correlation IDs for event linking
- Before/after state capture
- Monthly partitioning for performance
- Append-only file backup for redundancy

### 6. Promotion Gates and Risk Controls

**Decision**: 8-gate system with progressive allocation (1-2% initial, up to 10% full)
**Rationale**:
- Multiple gates prevent single-point failures
- Progressive rollout limits risk exposure
- 35-strategy limit maintains manageable portfolio

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single score threshold: Rejected as insufficiently comprehensive
- Manual review only: Rejected as not scalable
- Immediate full allocation: Rejected as too risky

**Gate Requirements**:
- Minimum score: 70/100
- Minimum trades: 30 for significance
- Maximum drawdown: 40%
- WFA degradation: < 30%
- Correlation limit: 0.7
- Positive returns: Required
- Volatility cap: 150% annualized
- Portfolio capacity: 35 strategies max

## Technology Stack Integration

### Existing Infrastructure Leverage

The implementation will maximize use of existing Chansey infrastructure:

1. **NestJS Modules**: New modules for strategy, scoring, monitoring, audit
2. **TypeORM Entities**: Strategy configs, backtest runs, audit logs
3. **BullMQ Jobs**: Parallel window processing, scheduled evaluations
4. **PostgreSQL**: Primary storage with partitioning for performance
5. **Redis**: Caching metrics, volatility data, correlation matrices
6. **Angular Components**: Dashboard visualizations with PrimeNG
7. **TanStack Query**: Frontend state management for real-time updates

### New Dependencies

Minimal new dependencies required:
- Statistical libraries for advanced calculations (already available in Node.js ecosystem)
- No new infrastructure components needed

## Performance Considerations

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Parallel Processing**
   - BullMQ workers for concurrent window evaluation
   - Batch strategy scoring to reduce database load
   - Parallel risk checks across deployments

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - Redis cache for frequently accessed metrics (5-minute TTL)
   - Materialized views for aggregated performance data
   - Price data caching for regime detection

3. **Database Optimization**
   - Partitioned audit tables by month
   - Indexed strategy performance queries
   - Read replicas for analytical workloads

### Expected Performance Metrics

- Walk-forward analysis: 15 strategies/hour throughput
- Scoring calculation: < 500ms per strategy
- Drift detection: < 1 second per strategy
- Regime detection: < 2 seconds for full calculation
- Audit query: < 5 seconds for 5-year history
- Dashboard load: < 2 seconds for 35 strategies

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

1. **Data Quality Issues**
   - Mitigation: Validate data checksums, handle missing data gracefully
   - Fallback: Manual review queue for anomalous results

2. **Performance Degradation**
   - Mitigation: Implement circuit breakers, rate limiting
   - Fallback: Prioritize critical strategies, defer non-critical evaluations

3. **False Positive Drift Alerts**
   - Mitigation: Require sustained drift (3+ checks) before action
   - Fallback: Manual review for critical decisions

### Business Risks

1. **Over-aggressive Promotion**
   - Mitigation: Conservative initial gates, progressive rollout
   - Monitoring: Track 90-day success rate of promoted strategies

2. **Insufficient Diversification**
   - Mitigation: Correlation limits, strategy type diversity requirements
   - Monitoring: Portfolio concentration metrics

3. **Regulatory Compliance**
   - Mitigation: Immutable audit logs, role-based access control
   - Documentation: Complete decision trail for all automated actions

## Implementation Complexity
