## Dependencies & Execution Order

1. **Phase 1 â†’ Phase 2**: Environment and feature flag setup must precede schema and queue provisioning.
2. **Phase 2 â†’ Phases 3â€“9**: Foundational entities, migrations, queues, and contracts required before story-specific work.
3. **User Story Dependencies**: US1 lays governance groundwork; US2 and US3 can proceed once entities exist. US4 depends on US3 outputs. US5 requires scorecards (US4). US6 depends on deployments (US5). US7 can parallel US6 once audits exist.

---

## Parallel Execution Examples

- US1 frontend service update (T015) can run parallel to component build after API contracts finalize.
- US2 integration test (T019) can execute alongside automation panel (T020) once scheduler logic exists.
- US3 optimization test (T024) may run in parallel with UI panel (T025) after service/processor land.
- US4 production tab UI (T029) can iterate concurrently with scheduler (T027) once scoring service drafted.
- US6 monitoring processor (T036) can be developed alongside risk tab UI (T037) after monitoring service is stubbed.
- US7 audit panel (T040) can progress in parallel with export service (T039) due to separate files.

---

## Implementation Strategy

1. **MVP (US1)**: Deliver strategy registry and governance APIs with corresponding research UI to unblock lifecycle metadata.
2. **Validation Automation (US2 & US3)**: Stand up autonomous triggers and optimization workflows to populate evaluation data.
3. **Decision & Deployment (US4 & US5)**: Produce unified scorecards feeding promotion workflows with enforced safety gates.
4. **Risk Oversight & Transparency (US6 & US7)**: Add monitoring, incidents, and audit surfaces to close governance loop.
5. **Polish**: Instrument telemetry, update documentation, and ensure guardrails are discoverable for operations teams.
3. **User Story Order**: US1 (historical) unlocks dataset usage; US2 (live replay) depends on shared pipeline from US1
   but can start once Phase 2 is complete and US1 telemetry helpers (T012â€“T015) land. US3 (comparison) depends on
   persisted metrics from US1 but not on US2.
4. **Polish Phase**: Execute after all desired user stories to finalize observability and documentation.

## Parallel Execution Examples

### User Story 1

```bash
# Backend tasks in parallel after T012 groundwork

```

### User Story 2

```bash
# Automation backend pieces

```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

### Parallel Team Strategy

- Backend engineer: Phase 2 â†’ US1 (T012â€“T015) â†’ US2 automation services (T016â€“T019).
- Frontend engineer: US1 UI (T014â€“T015) â†’ US2 admin controls (T020â€“T021) â†’ US3 dashboard (T026).
- Platform engineer: Observability + docs (T042â€“T044) concurrent once APIs stabilize.
