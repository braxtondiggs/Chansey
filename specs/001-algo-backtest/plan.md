# Implementation Plan: Algorithm Backtesting Integration

**Branch**: `001-algo-backtest` | **Date**: 2025-10-23 | **Spec**: specs/001-algo-backtest/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-algo-backtest/spec.md`

## Summary

Connect existing trading algorithms to the centralized backtesting workflow so analysts can run historical and live replay simulations, capture signals/results in the shared pipeline, and compare algorithm performance without enabling live order routing.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript (Nx monorepo targeting Angular 17+/NestJS 10+)  
**Primary Dependencies**: Angular with PrimeNG (frontend), NestJS with TypeORM, BullMQ, Redis, Nx task runners, shared `api-interfaces` library  
**Storage**: PostgreSQL (primary), Redis (caching/queues)  
**Testing**: Jest unit + integration suites via Nx, contract tests for external integrations per constitution  
**Target Platform**: Web frontend (Angular browser app) + Node.js backend services (NestJS microservices and workers)  
**Project Type**: Nx monorepo with modular microservices (apps/api, apps/chansey, libs/api-interfaces, background processors)  
**Performance Goals**: Backtests complete within 15 minutes for one-year datasets; replay signal latency under 5 seconds; adhere to constitution p95 API response limits (<200ms CRUD, <500ms aggregations)  
**Constraints**: No live trade execution from backtesting flows; maintain shared data pipeline consistency; respect auditing, RBAC, and trading governance rules; deterministic historical playback  
**Scale/Scope**: Supports multiple concurrent algorithms and replay sessions; results must cover at least five algorithms for comparison workflows

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **Code Quality**: Plan must outline maintainable updates within existing Nx structure, preserve strict typing, and document public APIs.
- **Testing Standards**: Design must include unit + integration coverage for new backtest pipelines and contract considerations for exchange data handling.
- **User Experience Consistency**: Frontend artifacts must rely on PrimeNG components and reflect loading/error handling for backtest operations.
- **Architectural Consistency**: No new apps/libs; extend apps/api, apps/chansey, background BullMQ processors, and shared interfaces.
- **Performance Requirements**: Ensure data pipeline and simulations respect response-time and throughput expectations; define caching/queue usage that aligns with existing Redis/BullMQ strategy.

**Post-Phase-1 Review**: Design artifacts (data model, contracts, quickstart) maintain compliance with all gates; no exceptions requested.

```

**Structure Decision**: Work will extend existing Nx apps (`apps/api`, `apps/chansey`) and supporting BullMQ processors/services while updating shared contracts in `libs/api-interfaces`. No new apps or libs will be introduced.
