# Research: Autonomous Strategy Lifecycle System

Phase 0 resolves outstanding questions and establishes defaults that guide data modeling, contracts, and implementation sequencing.

## 1. Market Regime Classification Baseline
- **Decision**: Use realized volatility percentiles per asset universe with three bands (0–20 calm, 20–80 neutral, 80–100 turbulent) generated by the existing regime classification service.
- **Rationale**: Percentile-based bands adapt to asset-specific volatility shifts, keep triggers reproducible, and align with robustness scoring requirements in the spec.
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Fixed VIX-style thresholds (rejected: does not translate to crypto pairs).
  - Exchange-provided regime flags (rejected: inconsistent coverage across Binance US vs. Coinbase).

## 2. Benchmark & Rollback Thresholds
- **Decision**: Compare each live strategy against a 30-day market-cap-weighted basket (BTC 60%, ETH 30%, top alt 10%); trigger rollback when trailing performance lags by >200 bps or drawdown exceeds 1.5× benchmark drawdown.
- **Rationale**: Provides a stable yet responsive baseline spanning core assets, matching governance expectations for live capital safeguards.
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Asset-specific benchmarks (rejected: introduces fragmented monitoring rules).
  - Absolute return targets (rejected: ignores market regime context).

## 3. Strategy Concurrency Targets
- **Decision**: Plan for at least 50 concurrent strategies undergoing validation workflows with overlapping queues.
- **Rationale**: Supports simultaneous research and production reviews while staying within current BullMQ scalability without immediate re-architecture.
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - 25-strategy baseline (rejected: insufficient headroom).
  - 75+ strategies (rejected: would require premature infrastructure expansion).

## 4. Scorecard Capacity & Performance
- **Decision**: Optimize unified scorecard generation for up to 80 strategies per run, completing within 2 minutes during peak load.
- **Rationale**: Covers typical quarterly review cohorts while maintaining manageable computation overhead.
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - 60-strategy limit (rejected: underestimates portfolio committee needs).
  - 100+ strategies (rejected: inflates compute cost without immediate value).

## 5. Audit Log Retention
- **Decision**: Retain immutable audit logs for a minimum of 7 years.
- **Rationale**: Satisfies common SEC/FINRA-style governance requirements and internal compliance audits.
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - 3–5 year retention (rejected: may violate regulatory expectations).
  - 10+ years (rejected: increases storage footprint without proven necessity).

## 6. Hyperparameter Optimization Strategy
- **Decision**: Employ hybrid search—start with Latin hypercube sampling to cover parameter space, refine with Bayesian optimization for top-performing regions, each run tagged with deterministic seeds stored in experiment artifacts.
- **Rationale**: Balances exploration and efficiency, matches need for reproducible trials, and integrates with existing TypeScript-based experimentation tooling.
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Pure grid search (rejected: inefficient for high-dimensional spaces).
  - Random search only (rejected: slower convergence to optimal parameter sets).

## 7. Monitoring & Alerting Channels
- **Decision**: Use existing observability stack (structured logs in ELK, metrics in Prometheus, alerts via PagerDuty/Slack) with new alert rules for benchmark lag, drawdown breaches, and regime-triggered re-evaluations.
- **Rationale**: Reuses approved tooling, accelerates rollout, and keeps auditability centralized.
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Introducing a new monitoring platform (rejected: extends compliance review timeline).
  - Email-only notifications (rejected: insufficient responsiveness for risk events).

## 8. Lifecycle UI Layout
- **Decision**: Provide three Angular dashboard tabs—Research (strategy registry, experiment status), Production (deployment approvals, capital allocation), Risk (live monitoring, incidents)—sharing PrimeNG table/chart components and TanStack Query caches.
- **Rationale**: Mirrors role-based workflows outlined in the spec, keeps UX consistent, and compartmentalizes permissions.
- **Alternatives considered**:
  - Single monolithic dashboard (rejected: harder to enforce role-based visibility).
  - Separate micro-frontends (rejected: exceeds scope and violates brownfield constraints).
