# Feature Specification: Algorithm Backtesting Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-algo-backtest`  
**Created**: 2025-10-23  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "We need to connect our existing trading algorithms to the backtesting system so performance can be measured and validated before live execution. This includes enabling algorithms to run in both live and historical replay modes while capturing their trading signals and results through a shared data pipeline. With these updates, we can track performance metrics, compare algorithms, and support optimization through a unified backtesting workflow. Do not enable live trading, just backtesting."

## Clarifications
### Session 2025-10-23
- Q: What level of observability needs to be captured for each backtest run? â†’ A: Structured logs plus run-scoped metrics and traces.



## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Validate algorithms against historical data (Priority: P1)

A quantitative analyst needs to run any approved trading algorithm against historical market data to confirm performance before proposing live deployment.

**Why this priority**: Historical validation is the minimum bar before an algorithm can advance in the review process.

**Independent Test**: Launch a historical backtest for a chosen algorithm and confirm the system produces a complete results package without relying on other features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a historical dataset and algorithm selection, **When** the analyst starts a backtest, **Then** the system processes the run and stores trading signals, orders, and fills in the shared pipeline.
2. **Given** multiple completed historical runs, **When** the analyst opens the results summary, **Then** the system displays time-series performance metrics (e.g., return, volatility, drawdown) and configuration metadata for each run.

### User Story 2 - Observe algorithm behavior in simulated live replay (Priority: P2)

An algorithm developer wants to replay recent market activity in near real time to observe how the strategy behaves under streaming conditions without risking actual capital.

**Why this priority**: Real-time replay highlights timing issues and operational gaps that may not appear in historical batch processing.

**Independent Test**: Trigger a live-mode simulation using recorded market feeds and confirm the system streams results while blocking outbound live orders.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a configured live replay session, **When** the developer starts the simulation, **Then** the system feeds timestamped market data to the algorithm and captures emitted signals in the shared pipeline with less than 5 seconds latency.
2. **Given** the simulation is running, **When** the algorithm attempts to place an external trade, **Then** the system intercepts the instruction and records it as a simulated action without routing to live markets.

---

### User Story 3 - Compare algorithm performance for decision making (Priority: P3)

A portfolio manager needs to compare results from multiple algorithms and timeframes to select candidates for further tuning or promotion.

**Why this priority**: Comparative insights drive investment decisions and optimization planning.

**Independent Test**: Review consolidated reports for selected runs and verify the manager can identify best-performing strategies without additional tooling.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** at least two completed backtest runs, **When** the manager requests a comparison report, **Then** the system presents aligned metrics, risk indicators, and benchmark references for each algorithm.
2. **Given** the manager filters results by timeframe or market regime, **When** the filter is applied, **Then** the system recalculates the comparison view using only the chosen runs.

### Edge Cases

- Historical data feed contains gaps or corrupted entries; system must flag the run and surface data quality warnings in results.
- Algorithm produces no trades or signals; system must still record the run as complete and highlight zero-activity outcomes.
- Multiple simulations request the same market data at once; system must queue or throttle runs while preserving data sequencing.
- Replay session loses connectivity mid-stream; system must pause the run, notify the user, and allow a restart without mixing partial results.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow authorized users to initiate backtests by selecting an algorithm, dataset, timeframe, and mode (historical batch or live replay).
- **FR-002**: System MUST execute historical backtests using time-ordered market data while ensuring deterministic playback for repeatable results.
- **FR-003**: System MUST execute live replay simulations that stream recorded market data in chronological order without sending orders to external venues.
- **FR-004**: System MUST capture all algorithm-generated signals, simulated orders, fills, and key telemetry in a shared data pipeline with timestamps and run identifiers.
- **FR-005**: System MUST compute and store standard performance metrics for each run, including return, drawdown, volatility, Sharpe-like ratios, trade win rate, and max adverse excursion.
- **FR-006**: System MUST attach configuration metadata (algorithm version, parameters, dataset source, run mode, execution window) to each run record for traceability.
- **FR-007**: Users MUST be able to retrieve run summaries, detailed trade logs, and performance charts through a unified reporting interface or export workflow within 5 minutes of run completion.
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide comparison views that display metrics for multiple runs side by side with filtering by algorithm, timeframe, or market regime.
- **FR-009**: System MUST enforce safeguards that block any connection from backtesting outputs to live trading gateways, even when live data feeds are used.
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain an audit history of run initiations, modifications, and cancellations including user identity and timestamp.

- **FR-011**: System MUST capture structured logs, run-scoped metrics, and trace spans for each backtest run to support auditing and performance diagnostics.
### Key Entities

- **Trading Algorithm**: Approved strategy definition with versioning, parameter sets, and ownership metadata.
- **Market Data Set**: Curated historical or recorded live market data segment with source, instrument universe, and quality notes.
- **Backtest Run**: Single execution instance referencing algorithm, dataset, mode, configuration, timestamps, and status.
- **Trading Signal**: Timed instruction emitted by an algorithm (entry, exit, order adjustments) captured for analysis.
- **Performance Metric**: Calculated quantitative outcome linked to a backtest run, covering returns, risk, and efficiency ratios.
- **Comparison Report**: Aggregated view that groups multiple runs, applies filters, and presents aligned metrics for decision making.

## Assumptions

- Governance process already controls which algorithms are eligible for backtesting; this feature does not alter entitlements.
- Market data storage and retention policies are sufficient to support replay without additional compliance approvals.
- Users access the system through existing authentication and authorization layers; no new roles are introduced here.
- Performance metric definitions align with current investment committee standards and require no new formulas.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: 95% of historical backtests for datasets up to one year of minute-level data complete with full results packages within 15 minutes of initiation.
- **SC-002**: 100% of live replay sessions capture emitted signals and simulated orders in the shared pipeline with under 5 seconds average lag from generation to availability.
- **SC-003**: Portfolio managers can generate a comparison report covering at least five algorithms within 3 minutes, and at least 90% report the output is sufficient for decision meetings.
- **SC-004**: Zero live trades are routed from backtesting sessions during user acceptance testing and production monitoring of this feature.

- **SC-005**: 100% of backtests emit structured logs, metrics, and traces retrievable within 2 minutes for audit or diagnostics.
