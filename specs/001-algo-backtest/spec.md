## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### User Story 1 - Register and govern strategies (Priority: P0)

A quantitative research lead needs to register new algorithmic strategies, manage versions, and assign governance
metadata so the organization can trace every change from research through production.

**Why this priority**: The lifecycle requires a trustworthy registry before any automation can run.

**Independent Test**: Register a new strategy with required metadata, update its version, and confirm the registry
reflects the history with restricted access based on role.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a research user with proper permissions, **When** they register a strategy, **Then** the system stores
   metadata (owner, objectives, eligible markets, version seed) and confirms visibility is limited to approved roles.
2. **Given** a strategy already in the registry, **When** a new version with updated parameters is submitted, **Then**
   the previous version remains immutable in history and the new version is marked pending validation until automation
   completes.

---

### User Story 2 - Autonomous backtest scheduling (Priority: P1)

A research operations engineer wants backtests to launch automatically whenever fresh signals indicate the strategy
should be reevaluated (new data, regime shifts, or parameter changes) so the team never misses a validation cycle.

**Why this priority**: Timely validation underpins the scoring and deployment decisions.

**Independent Test**: Inject each triggering event and confirm a matching backtest (or set) is scheduled without manual
intervention.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** new market data arrives for an instrument universe, **When** the data is certified, **Then** the system
   schedules backtests for all impacted strategies within the defined latency window and tags the runs with dataset
   timestamps and checksums.
2. **Given** the regime classification service detects a volatility regime change, **When** the event is published,
   **Then** the system queues regime-specific backtests and robustness analyses for affected strategies.
3. **Given** a strategy version or parameter space update is approved for evaluation, **When** the registry status
   changes, **Then** the system launches the required validation runs and flags dependencies in the experiment tracker.

---

### User Story 3 - Hyperparameter optimization & walk-forward analysis (Priority: P1)

A quant analyst requires automated hyperparameter optimization that evaluates strategies across rolling time windows and
market regimes to highlight robust configurations.

**Why this priority**: Walk-forward and robustness scoring ensures recommended strategies generalize.

**Independent Test**: For a selected strategy, trigger the optimization workflow and confirm rolling segments, regime
splits, and robustness metrics are produced and stored.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an optimization job is triggered, **When** the system partitions data into rolling train/test windows,
   **Then** each segment executes with recorded parameter sets and produces out-of-sample metrics.
2. **Given** multiple market regimes are recognized, **When** optimization completes, **Then** the system stores
   robustness scores comparing configurations across regimes and highlights any overfitting alerts.

---

### User Story 4 - Unified scoring and ranking (Priority: P2)

A portfolio selection committee needs a single scorecard that blends risk-adjusted returns, drawdown controls, win-rate
stability, and overfitting indicators so they can compare strategies quickly.

**Why this priority**: Decision makers rely on a consistent ranking before promoting strategies.

**Independent Test**: Generate the consolidated scorecard for a cohort of strategies and confirm weightings, rankings,
and recommendations are produced.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** completed experiments for several strategies, **When** the scorecard is generated, **Then** the system
   calculates Sharpe, Sortino, Calmar, drawdown, tail-risk, win-rate consistency, and drift metrics and aggregates them
   into a normalized score.
2. **Given** rank thresholds are configured, **When** scores fall below minimum production standards, **Then** the
   system marks strategies as research-only and prevents deployment actions.

---

### User Story 5 - Safe deployment and rollback (Priority: P2)

A production trading lead wants top-ranked strategies to deploy automatically into live trading once approvals and
safety gates pass, and to rollback instantly if live performance deteriorates.

**Why this priority**: Automation creates competitive speed while respecting risk controls.

**Independent Test**: Approve a top-ranked strategy for production, observe live deployment, simulate performance
degradation, and confirm automatic rollback including audit trails.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a strategy meets promotion criteria and receives production approval, **When** the deployment workflow
   runs, **Then** the system enforces capital allocation limits, activates the strategy in live trading, and records the
   promotion details.
2. **Given** live monitoring detects a breach of risk thresholds or benchmark underperformance, **When** the condition
   persists beyond the configured window, **Then** the system disables the strategy, reallocates capital per policy, and
   logs a rollback event for review.

---

### User Story 6 - Continuous monitoring and re-evaluation (Priority: P2)

A risk manager needs the platform to observe live performance, regime shifts, and benchmark drift continuously so
strategies are re-tested before causing losses.

**Why this priority**: Proactive monitoring protects capital and ensures governance compliance.

**Independent Test**: Operate a live strategy, inject simulated risk and regime events, and confirm the system pauses
trading, schedules re-tests, and notifies stakeholders.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a live strategy, **When** a monitored risk metric (e.g., drawdown, value-at-risk) crosses warning
   thresholds, **Then** the system issues alerts, schedules re-evaluation tasks, and applies capital throttles per
   policy.
2. **Given** performance deteriorates versus the trailing benchmark, **When** the variance exceeds configured limits,
   **Then** the system triggers re-validation workflows and keeps the strategy in a degraded state until new results
   pass safety gates.

---

### User Story 7 - Transparent interfaces and auditability (Priority: P3)

Compliance officers and stakeholders require APIs, UI dashboards, and audit logs that surface experiment histories,
deployment actions, and live monitoring activity.

**Why this priority**: Transparency ensures regulatory and internal governance obligations are met.

**Independent Test**: Review dashboards and logs for a single strategy from research through production and verify all
events are accessible, immutable, and exportable.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** authorized stakeholders access the platform, **When** they open the lifecycle dashboard, **Then** the
   system displays experiment comparisons, promotion history, and current live status with downloadable artifacts.
2. **Given** compliance needs an audit trail, **When** they query the audit log API, **Then** every registration, test
   run, deployment, and rollback event is retrieved with timestamps, actor identity, dataset checksum, and engine
   version references.

---

### Edge Cases

- Simultaneous triggers (e.g., new data and regime change) occur; the system must deduplicate work while preserving
  traceability of both events.
- A worker queue outage happens mid-optimization; the system must retry safely without losing experiment metadata or
  over-allocating capital.
- Strategy scoring inputs contain missing metrics due to data anomalies; the system must flag incomplete scoring,
  prevent deployment, and notify research teams.
- Live trading connectors become unavailable during automated deployment; the system must halt promotions, notify
  production owners, and maintain queued approvals.
- Regulatory hold is placed on a strategy; the system must freeze automated actions while retaining audit evidence of
  the hold.

## Assumptions

- Existing data ingestion and regime classification services will surface certified events that this system can
  subscribe to; building those services is out of scope.
- Live trading connectors already support programmatic activation/deactivation and capital allocation controls.
- Organizational roles (research, production, risk, compliance) and authentication layers exist; this feature extends
  permissions but does not create new identity providers.
- Infrastructure for worker queues, storage, and monitoring can scale horizontally with configuration changes rather
  than new platform builds.
- Benchmark definitions and risk thresholds will be supplied by the risk committee before deployment.

---

  workflows within 5 minutes of event receipt.
- **SC-002**: 100% of active strategies maintain complete version, parameter, dataset, and engine history accessible
  through the registry and audit APIs.
