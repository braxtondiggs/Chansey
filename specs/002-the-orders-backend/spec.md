## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

---

## Clarifications

### Q1: Which order types should the system support?
**Answer**: Full suite including Market, Limit, Stop-Loss, Stop-Limit, Trailing Stop, Take-Profit, and OCO (One-Cancels-Other) orders

**Rationale**: Maximum flexibility for traders to execute complex trading strategies with comprehensive risk management tools. This aligns with professional trading platform expectations.

**Impact on Requirements**:
- FR-002: Expanded to support all major order types
- FR-006: Requires handling diverse exchange-specific parameters for each order type
- FR-038: UI complexity increases significantly with conditional form fields per order type
- NFR-012: Order placement time may extend for complex order types

### Q2: What reasonable price range should the system enforce for limit orders?
**Answer**: No validation - maximum freedom with user responsibility for all price inputs

**Rationale**: Professional traders need complete control over their order prices, especially during high volatility or when implementing advanced strategies. The system should trust users to set their own risk parameters rather than imposing artificial constraints.

**Impact on Requirements**:
- FR-013: Removed price range validation constraint
- NFR-010: Error messages will focus on other validation issues, not price reasonableness
- UI will include warnings for orders significantly distant from market price but will not prevent submission

### Q3: Which cryptocurrency exchanges should the system support?
**Answer**: Current connected exchanges only - support any exchange that users have already connected via existing exchange keys

**Rationale**: Leverages existing exchange connection infrastructure without requiring new integrations. Users control which exchanges are available by managing their exchange key connections. This approach minimizes development scope while providing maximum flexibility as users add new exchange connections.

**Impact on Requirements**:
- FR-028: Updated to support all exchanges users have connected (dynamic list)
- FR-029: Must query available trading pairs from each user's connected exchanges
- FR-031: Must handle fee structures for any exchange the user connects (CCXT provides standardization)
- FR-032: Must respect rate limits for any exchange (CCXT handles this automatically)
- No new exchange integration work required - reuses existing exchange key infrastructure

### Q4: How frequently should order status updates refresh from exchanges?
**Answer**: Manual refresh only with background synchronization via existing order-sync.task.ts

**Rationale**: The existing order sync task keeps the database synchronized with exchanges in the background. Users can manually refresh to see latest status on-demand. This approach minimizes API consumption, respects exchange rate limits, and avoids complexity of real-time WebSocket connections while still providing reasonably current data through the scheduled sync task.

**Impact on Requirements**:
- NFR-003: Order status updates reflect via scheduled background sync (order-sync.task.ts) plus manual user-triggered refresh
- FR-021: Status updates occur through existing sync infrastructure rather than real-time polling
- FR-032: Minimal impact on rate limits - leverages existing sync task pattern
- UI must provide manual refresh button for users who want immediate status updates
- Background sync keeps data current without user action (existing hourly pattern can be tuned if needed)

### Q5: How many concurrent order placements should the system handle?
**Answer**: 50 concurrent orders (supporting up to 10 maximum users)

**Rationale**: This capacity accommodates a small team of traders (up to 10 users) placing multiple orders simultaneously during high market volatility periods. The constraint of 10 max users provides clear capacity planning for infrastructure and aligns with a controlled user base for a manual trading system.

**Impact on Requirements**:
- NFR-004: System must handle 50 concurrent order placements without degradation
- Infrastructure planning: Database connection pool, API server resources scaled for 10 concurrent users
- Testing scenarios: Load tests should validate 50 simultaneous order submissions
- No need for complex horizontal scaling or distributed architecture
- Standard NestJS/PostgreSQL setup sufficient for this scale

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a cryptocurrency trader, I want to manually place buy and sell orders across multiple exchanges so that I can execute trades based on my own analysis without relying on automated algorithms. The current order system is broken and half-implemented, making it difficult or impossible to reliably place trades. I need a working, complete order placement system that allows me to:
- Select an exchange from my connected accounts
- Choose a trading pair (e.g., BTC/USD, ETH/BTC)
- Specify order type and parameters
- Execute the order and track its status
- Cancel orders if needed

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Place a Market Buy Order
1. **Given** I am logged in and have connected my Binance US exchange account
2. **When** I navigate to the trading interface
3. **And** I select Binance US as my exchange
4. **And** I select BTC/USD as the trading pair
5. **And** I choose "Market" as the order type
6. **And** I enter "Buy" as the side and "0.01" BTC as the quantity
7. **And** I click "Place Order"
8. **Then** the system MUST validate my order parameters
9. **And** the system MUST show me a preview with estimated cost and fees
10. **And** when I confirm, the system MUST submit the order to Binance US
11. **And** the system MUST display the order status as "Filled" or "Pending"
12. **And** the system MUST show the order in my order history

#### Scenario 2: Place a Limit Sell Order
1. **Given** I hold 0.5 ETH in my Coinbase account
2. **When** I select Coinbase as my exchange
3. **And** I select ETH/USD as the trading pair
4. **And** I choose "Limit" as the order type
5. **And** I enter "Sell" as the side, "0.5" ETH as quantity, and "$2,500" as limit price
6. **And** I click "Place Order"
7. **Then** the system MUST validate that I have sufficient balance
8. **And** the system MUST show order preview with limit price
9. **And** when I confirm, the system MUST place the limit order on Coinbase
10. **And** the order MUST remain open until price is reached or I cancel it

#### Scenario 3: Cancel an Open Order
1. **Given** I have an open limit order on Kraken
2. **When** I view my order history
3. **And** I select the open order
4. **And** I click "Cancel Order"
5. **Then** the system MUST cancel the order on Kraken
6. **And** the order status MUST update to "Canceled"
7. **And** any locked funds MUST be returned to my available balance

#### Scenario 4: View Order Status and History
1. **Given** I have placed multiple orders across different exchanges
2. **When** I navigate to my order history
3. **Then** I MUST see all my orders with current status
4. **And** I MUST be able to filter by exchange, status, and date
5. **And** I MUST see order details including fees, executed price, and timestamps

### Edge Cases

#### Insufficient Balance
- **What happens when** a user tries to place an order without sufficient funds?
- **Expected**: System MUST validate balance before order placement, display clear error message showing available balance vs. required amount (including fees)

#### Exchange Connection Failure
- **What happens when** the exchange API is unreachable during order placement?
- **Expected**: System MUST detect connection failure, display error message, NOT persist failed order, allow retry

#### Partial Order Fills
- **What happens when** a market order is only partially filled?
- **Expected**: System MUST record partial fill, update order status to "Partially Filled", show executed vs. requested quantity, keep order open if applicable

#### Invalid Trading Pair
- **What happens when** a user selects a trading pair not supported by the chosen exchange?
- **Expected**: System MUST only show valid trading pairs for selected exchange, prevent selection of invalid pairs

#### Order Conflicts
- **What happens when** a user places an order that would exceed exchange-specific limits (position size, order value, daily limits)?
- **Expected**: System MUST validate against exchange limits before submission, display specific limit violation error

#### Stale Price Data
- **What happens when** market prices change significantly between order preview and execution?
- **Expected**: For market orders, system MUST execute at current market price. For limit orders, system MUST place order at specified price regardless of market movement
