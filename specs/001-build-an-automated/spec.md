# Feature Specification: Automated Cryptocurrency Trading Platform

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-automated`
**Created**: 2025-09-30
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build an automated cryptocurrency trading platform that uses research-driven algorithms to make intelligent trading decisions on behalf of users, operating directly within users' connected exchange wallets without requiring manual intervention. The platform eliminates the complexity of manual crypto trading by implementing sophisticated trading strategies and market analysis algorithms that automatically execute trades in users' own exchange accounts, allowing passive investors to benefit from cryptocurrency markets without requiring trading expertise or constant monitoring."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-30
- Q: Which cryptocurrency exchanges should be supported initially? ‚Üí A: Binance US and Coinbase
- Q: What is the maximum acceptable latency for trade execution after an algorithm signals? ‚Üí A: Under 5 minutes (batch-style processing acceptable, with plan to improve speed later)
- Q: How should the system handle partial order fills from exchanges? ‚Üí A: Accept partial fills and log as successful (no retry)
- Q: How should trade size limits be determined and enforced? ‚Üí A: Percentage of portfolio per trade, with dynamic adjustment based on algorithm performance ranking
- Q: What algorithm performance metrics should be displayed to users? ‚Üí A: Comprehensive metrics including ROI, win rate, Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, total trades, risk-adjusted returns, volatility, alpha/beta

### Session 2025-10-07
- Q: Can users manually activate/deactivate trading algorithms? ‚Üí A: No. The backend automatically manages algorithm activation based on performance metrics and user risk settings. Users control behavior indirectly through risk preferences.
- Q: Can users make manual trades from the frontend? ‚Üí A: Yes. Users can execute manual trades separately from automated algorithm trading.
- Q: Should users see algorithm details, names, or strategies? ‚Üí A: No. Algorithm details are trade secrets visible only to administrators. Users see aggregate performance and control risk preferences.
- Q: Does risk preference setting already exist in frontend? ‚Üí A: Yes. User settings page already has risk preference controls. Backend needs to consume this setting for algorithm selection.

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a passive cryptocurrency investor, I want the system to automatically execute trades on my behalf using sophisticated algorithms that are dynamically selected based on performance, so that I can benefit from cryptocurrency market opportunities without requiring trading expertise or constant monitoring. The system should connect to my existing exchange account, analyze market conditions, and intelligently select and execute the best-performing algorithms based on my risk preferences.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has connected their exchange account with valid API credentials and set their risk preferences, **When** the backend evaluates algorithm performance, **Then** the system automatically activates the best-performing algorithms that match the user's risk profile and begins executing trades without requiring user intervention.

2. **Given** an algorithm is performing poorly relative to others, **When** the backend performance evaluation runs, **Then** the system automatically deactivates the underperforming algorithm and reallocates to better performers based on the user's risk settings.

3. **Given** an algorithm is actively running, **When** market conditions meet the algorithm's criteria, **Then** the system executes a trade in the user's exchange account and records the transaction details.

4. **Given** a user wants to review trading performance, **When** they access their trading dashboard, **Then** the system displays trade history, performance metrics, algorithm effectiveness, and which algorithms are currently active based on performance.

5. **Given** a user wants to adjust automated trading behavior, **When** they modify their risk preference settings (conservative/moderate/aggressive), **Then** the backend automatically adjusts algorithm selection and allocation percentages to match the new risk profile.

6. **Given** a user wants to execute a trade manually, **When** they use the manual trading interface, **Then** the system executes the trade independently of any algorithm-driven trades.

7. **Given** multiple users with different risk preferences, **When** the system processes trades, **Then** each user's trades are isolated, executed only within their connected exchange accounts, and algorithm selection respects their individual risk settings.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when exchange API credentials become invalid or expire during active trading?
- How does the system handle insufficient funds in the exchange account when an algorithm signals a trade?
- What happens when an exchange is temporarily unavailable or experiencing downtime?
- How does the system handle partial order fills or rejected orders from the exchange?
- What happens when multiple algorithms signal conflicting trades simultaneously?
- How does the system handle rate limiting from exchange APIs?
- What happens when market conditions change rapidly during trade execution?
- How does the system handle user account suspension or trading restrictions on the exchange?
