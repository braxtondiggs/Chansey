# Feature Specification: Complete Crypto Trading UI Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `003-order-type-fields`
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Order Type Fields - The component validates all order types (Market, Limit, Stop Loss, etc.) but the template doesn't show the appropriate input fields. Users need to see price fields for limit orders, stop prices for stop-loss orders, and trailing amounts for trailing stops. Add *ngIf directives using your existing helper methods: shouldShowPriceField(), shouldShowStopPriceField(), shouldShowTrailingFields(), shouldShowTakeProfitField(), and shouldShowStopLossField(). Each order type requires specific inputs - limit orders need price, stop-limits need both stop and limit prices, OCO orders need take profit and stop loss prices. Order Preview - Your buyOrderPreview and sellOrderPreview signals store preview data, but it's not displayed. Users need to see estimated cost, trading fees, total required funds, available balance, and whether they have sufficient funds before submitting. This preview should update in real-time as they input values, helping them understand the impact of fees and whether they can afford the trade. Active Orders - The activeOrdersQuery fetches data and cancelOrderMutation is ready, but there's no table to display orders. Add a table showing date, pair, type, side, price, quantity, filled amount, status (using your getStatusClass()), and cancel buttons for \"NEW\" or \"PARTIALLY_FILLED\" orders. Market Price Display - Users entering limit/stop prices need current market context. Display selectedPair()?.currentPrice prominently with the 24-hour change styled using priceChangeClass(). This helps users set informed limit prices. Validation Feedback - Forms have validation rules but no visual feedback. Add isFieldInvalid() and getFieldError() methods to show error messages below invalid fields using p-error class. Users need to know why their input is rejected, especially for the quantity field's minimum value requirement. Submit Button States - Disable buy/sell buttons when forms are invalid or balance is insufficient: [disabled]=\"!buyOrderForm.valid || !buyOrderPreview()?.hasSufficientBalance\". Show loading state during submission with createOrderMutation.isPending(). Exchange Selection - When selectedExchangeId() is null, show a prominent message prompting users to select an exchange. The trading interface should be disabled until an exchange is selected. Balance Display - Show available balances using getAvailableBuyBalance() and getAvailableSellBalance() in the UI. Display how much balance remains after the trade, updating in real-time as users input quantities. Percentage Buttons - Your quickAmountOptions and percentage methods exist, but the 25%/50%/75%/Max buttons aren't in the template. Add PrimeNG SelectButton components that use setQuantityPercentage() and calculateMaxBuyQuantityWithFees() for the Max button. Order Book - The orderBookQuery fetches data and you have getTopBids()/getTopAsks() methods, but no order book widget exists. Add a table showing current bids/asks so users can see market depth and click prices to auto-fill their orders."

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a cryptocurrency trader, I need a comprehensive trading interface that shows me all necessary input fields based on my selected order type, provides real-time cost previews before I submit trades, displays my active orders with management capabilities, and gives me market context (current prices, order book depth) so that I can make informed trading decisions and execute orders confidently.

### Acceptance Scenarios

#### Scenario 3: Active Order Management
1. **Given** a user has active orders, **When** viewing the orders table, **Then** all orders are shown with date, pair, type, side, price, quantity, filled amount, and status
2. **Given** an order has status "NEW" or "PARTIALLY_FILLED", **When** viewing the order, **Then** a cancel button is available
3. **Given** a user clicks cancel on an active order, **When** cancellation completes, **Then** order status updates and order is removed from active list
4. **Given** an order has status "FILLED", "CANCELED", or "REJECTED", **When** viewing the order, **Then** no cancel button is shown

4. **Given** form is valid and balance is sufficient, **When** no submission in progress, **Then** button is enabled

#### Scenario 7: Exchange Selection Requirement
1. **Given** no exchange is selected, **When** viewing trading interface, **Then** prominent message prompts user to select an exchange
2. **Given** no exchange is selected, **When** viewing order forms, **Then** all trading inputs are disabled
3. **Given** user selects an exchange, **When** selection completes, **Then** trading interface becomes fully functional

4. **Given** a user clicks Max button, **When** calculation includes fees, **Then** quantity shows maximum tradeable amount after fee deduction

#### Scenario 10: Order Book Integration
1. **Given** order book data is available, **When** viewing trading interface, **Then** top bids and asks are displayed in table format
2. **Given** a user sees order book prices, **When** clicking a bid/ask price, **Then** order form price field auto-fills with selected value
3. **Given** order book updates occur, **When** new market data arrives, **Then** bid/ask table refreshes automatically

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user switches order type mid-entry? (Form should clear type-specific fields to prevent invalid combinations)
- How does system handle extremely small quantities below exchange minimums? (Show specific error with exchange's minimum requirement)
- What if order preview fails to calculate? (Show error state, disable submit, suggest checking inputs)
- How does system handle network delays during order submission? (Show loading state, prevent duplicate submissions, show timeout after reasonable period)
- What happens when user has open orders but balance becomes insufficient? (Orders remain open, new orders blocked until balance increases)
- How does interface handle rapid order book updates? (Throttle/debounce updates to prevent UI flicker)
- What if user attempts to cancel an already-filled order? (Show appropriate error message explaining order already completed)
- How does system handle partial fills during display? (Real-time update of filled amount and remaining quantity)
